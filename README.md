## ✅ Prerequisites

Make sure you have a recent version of `NodeJS` and `npm`
Make sure you have set up an OpenAI API Key as an Environment Variable [according to their instructions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart/step-2-set-up-your-api-key).

## ⬇️ Installation

`npm i -g gpt-voice-session-playback`

## ❓ How to use

1. Open the chat you want to replay and copy the entire chat
2. Run `gpt-voice-session-playback` in the terminal. This will read the contents of your clipboard and start playback.

## 📋 Todo

- Add a bin command that makes step 2 above possible
- Scrape chat from share link rather than clipboard
